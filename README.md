# Scene Assignment Instructions
# Objective

Create a visually appealing scene using the HTML5 <canvas> element. The scene should include:

  -  A background image

  -  At least two foreground images

  - Text displaying your name and the scene title

Steps

    Set Up Your HTML File

        Create an HTML file and set up the basic structure:

          -  Include a <canvas> element with an ID.

          -  Link a JavaScript file.

    Prepare Your JavaScript File

        Create a JavaScript file to initialize your canvas and context:

          -  Use getElementById to get the canvas element.

          -  Use getContext('2d') to get the canvas context.

    Load and Draw the Background Image

        Load a background image and draw it on the canvas:

           - Create an Image object.

           - Set the src attribute to the path of your background image within the images subfolder.

           - Use the onload event to draw the image on the canvas.

    Load and Draw Foreground Images

      -  Find at least two images you want to use in front of your background.

      -  Create Image objects for each of your chosen images.

      -  Set the src attribute to the path where you’ve saved these images in the images subfolder.

      -  Once the images load, use onload to place and draw them on your canvas.

      -  Play around with their positions and sizes to fit them nicely in your scene.

    Add Text to the Canvas

        Draw text displaying your name and the picture title on the canvas:

           - Use the font property to set the font style and size.

          -  Use the fillStyle property to set the text color.

          -  Use the fillText method to draw the text on the canvas.

Submission

    Save your HTML, JavaScript, and image files in a single project folder, with images stored in an images subfolder.

    Make sure all images are properly linked and included in the images subfolder.

    Upload the entire project folder to your GitHub Pages site.

    Ensure that all images and files are uploaded correctly.

    Test the project from another device to make sure the images load properly.

    Place a link to your project on your portfolio page.

Tips

    Experiment with different positions and sizes for your images.

    Use different fonts and colors for your text to make it visually appealing.

    Ensure all images are accessible by providing the correct path
